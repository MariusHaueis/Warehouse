# Warehouse
This is my first attempt to create a programm which is able to manage deliveries and orders. Also saves the customers and is able to return the status such as inventory at any time.

The products that can be stored are "Pen", "Compass" and "Triangle_Ruler".
Those can be changed or new can be added with only a few  new/more lines in the ItemType and Company class.

The size of the warehouses(representing the total amount of items that can be stored of the specific product type)
The values can be changed in the WarehouseConsole class in the object generation( line 38)

You can also add a number of branches by creating more company objects in the constructor of the WarehouseApp class.
